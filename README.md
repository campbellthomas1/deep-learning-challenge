### Overview
- The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Steps
- Step 1: Preprocess the Data
- Step 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
- Step 3: Optimize the Model
- Step 4: Write a Report on the Neural Network Model

## Challenges
- I struggled a little but with getting the accuract above 80%, sometimes I was not sure if I shoudl change the neurons, layers, or activation functions. I think getting rid of columns helped but maybe I was getting rid of the wrong ones. It is interesting to see the machine learn and adapt as you change features.
